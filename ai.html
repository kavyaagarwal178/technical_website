<h2 class="define">What is artifical intelligence</h2>
<h3 class="defin">
1- Study of computer system that attempt to model and apply the intelligence of human mind.<br>
2- A branch of computer science dealing with the stimulation of intelligent behaviour in computers.<br>
3- The capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behaviour.<br>
</h3><br>

<!--principles-->
<h2 class="define">Principles</h2><br>
<h3 class="defin">
1- Reasoning,knowledge,planning,learning and communication<br>
2- Perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects<br>
3- It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines,especially intelligent computer programs.<br>
</h3><br>

<!--history-->
<h2 class="define">History</h2>
<p class="hea">1950</p>
<h3 class="defin">The time when it all started</h3>
<p class="hea">1955</p>

</h3>

<!--applications-->
<h2 class="define">Applications</h2>
<p class="hea">Medicine</p>
<h3 class="defin">
1- A medical clinic can use ai systems to organize bed schedules,make a staff rotation and provide medical information.<br>
2- AI also has applications in field of cardiology,neurology,sonography and complex operations of internal organs.<br>
3- It also has an application in image guided surgery and image analysis and enhancement.</h3>


<p class="hea">Music</p>
<h3 class="defin">
1- Scientists are trying to make the computer emulate the activities of the skillful musician.<br>
2- Composition,performance,music theory,sound proceesing are the areas on which research in music and AI is going on.<br>
</h3>

<p class="hea">telecommunications</p>
<h3 class="defin">
1- Many telecommunications companies make use of heuristic search in the management of the workforces.<br>
2- For eg:BT group has deployed heuristic search in a scheduling application that provides the work schedules of 2000 engineers.<br>
</h3>

<p class="hea">Gaming</p>
<h3 class="defin">
1- Physicist Willy Higinbotham created the first video game in 1958.<br>
2- Was known as 'Tennis for tow'.<br>
3- But now AI technology has become vast and standard  has also been increased.for eg- sudoko,fallout etc.<br>
