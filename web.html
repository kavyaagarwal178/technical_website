<h1 class="topic">What is web development?</h1>
<p class="paragraph">
Web development is the process of building and maintaining a website for the Internet or an intranet that is accessed through a web browser and hosted on a server, either on on-premises hardware or in the cloud. This includes everything from single plain-text webpages up to complex web applications.
The primary methods when developing a website include coding and web markup. However, there are a multitude of development tasks that also go into web development, such as scripting, security configuration, content development and ecommerce infrastructure.

<!--different types of web development-->
<h1 class="topic">Types of web development</h1>
<p class="paragraph">
1- <u class="d">Front end development</u><br>
<p class="paragraph">Front-end developers are responsible for a website’s look and feel. front-end devs must be masters at three main languages, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. They also need to be familiar with frameworks like Bootstrap, AngularJS, and EmberJS, which make the website look more interactive & alive. libraries like jQuery also help to package code into a lightweight and compatible form.</p>
</p>
2-<u class="d">Backend development</u><br>
<p class="paragraph">A back-end developer creates and maintains the web server, application and the database which allows the front end of the website to operate.
To make the server, application, and database communicate with each other, back-end devs use server-side languages like PHP, Ruby, Python, Java, and .Net to build an application. They also require to operate tools like MySQL, SQL, to fetch, store or edit data and then serve it back to the user in front-end.</p>
</p>
3-<u class="d">Full stack web developer</u><br>
<p class="paragraph">The term “full stack developer” was popularised in a seminar around 8 years ago when Facebook announced that they’re looking to hire only “full stack web developers”.
Basically, a full stack developer should be knowledgeable enough to work on both the front end tech and the back end tech. So he must have an understanding of how the web works at each and every level, including setting up and configuring Linux or windows servers, coding server-side APIs, Running the client -side of the application by using javascript, and structuring and designing the webpage with CSS and HTML.
A full stack developer is like the jack of all trades. One must have enough knowledge to run both the client and scripting side.
